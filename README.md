# Pathnex 30-Day DevOps Hands-On Challenge

This repository contains a complete 30-day practical DevOps learning challenge.  
Each day includes:

- Ansible YAML task  
- Terraform AWS EC2 task  
- Kubernetes YAML task  
- Shell scripting task  
- Jenkins Pipeline task  
- GitLab CI/CD pipeline task  
- Full example code (students must retype manually)

EC2 instance types used:  
- c5.xlarge  
- r5.2xlarge  
- r6i.4xlarge  
- c6i.8xlarge  
- c6a.12xlarge  

Naming convention:  
Everything uses "Pathnex" (e.g., PathnexEC2, PathnexVPC, PathnexDeployment, Pathnex-Training).

Environment variables used in pipelines:  
- INSTITUTE_NAME = "Pathnex"  
- TEAM = "DevOps"  
- ENV = "prod"  
- PROJECT = "Pathnex-Training"  

Students must **rewrite all code from scratch** to improve speed, understanding, and real-world readiness.  

Happy learning,  
Pathnex
